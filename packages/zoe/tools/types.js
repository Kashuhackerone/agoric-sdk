 * createRepeater Create and return a repeater that will schedule `wake()` calls
 * repeatedly at times that are a multiple of interval following delay.

 * called after the next multiple of interval from the base. Since times can be
 * coarse-grained, the actual call may occur later, but this won't change when
 * the next event will be called.
